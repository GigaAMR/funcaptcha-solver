# Funcaptcha Solver
This plugin enables image recognition for Funcaptcha using the cap.guru api. It was created purely for testing purposes. If Funcaptcha officials want it to be removed, it is enough to contact zfcsoftware@gmail.com mail address. If removal is requested, this repository will be removed quickly. 

# Usage
Simply enter your cap.guru api key in the apiKey variable at the beginning of the foreground.js file and install this plugin in the browser you want to use.

Question text is required for cap guru to identify what is in the image. The question text is being sent, but it only supports the English language. Therefore you should use it in an English language browser.
